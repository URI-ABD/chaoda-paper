We appreciate the opportunity to respond to reviewers.
We also appreciate the constructive comments from the reviewers, particularly the suggestions by Reviewer 5 about the paper organization and code docstrings.
We have concerns about some of the reviews, in particular the one from Reviewer 3.
We address these point-by-point, as well as describe changes to the manuscript based on these reviews.
Reviewer 3 claimed that there was no theoretical analysis in the paper; this is simply not true.
We give complexity bounds for CLAM and CHAODA in Section 2.1.
Reviewer 3 also claimed that we learned hyperparameters on a training dataset, but that this is not possible as the problem is unsupervised.
However, this conflates two things: for all datasets under evaluation, ground truth is known.
Of course, only for the training datasets do we use this ground truth (labels of anomalous or outlier datapoints) to learn what we believe to be generalizable geometric properties of manifolds, which we then evaluate on the test datasets.
\emph{We have added language to Section X of the manuscript in order to clarify this point}.
Reviewer 3 claims there is no novelty, because the clustering is na\"ive and the scoring methods are simple heuristics.
We disagree that this lacks novelty; there is clearly great power in a clustering approach that efficiently maps out a manifold in high-dimensional space, such that even such simple methods outperform competing methods.

Reviewer 4 points out that ``It is well known that the stationary distribution for random walks on an undirected graph has a closed form'' but this is incorrect when the edge weights are not uniform.
Thus, we cannot use this closed form on the CLAM graph.
\emph{We have added language to this effect in Section X of the manuscript.}
Reviewer 4 also states ``A cluster having low degree could arise for many reasons: maybe the points are truly isolated, or maybe the distribution and multi-modal, and a cluster happens to be far away from everything else. 
This brings me to a general weakness of the paper: there is a lot of mathematical notions mentioned that are not really put to use in any concrete sense (fractal-dimension, the idea of manifold learning)...''
\emph{We have added language to clarify how and why fractal dimension is used, and connect the manifold mapping to this reviewer's concern about how the graph is used}.
Reviewer 4 states ``the paper needs to be more precise here: what is the AUC, can you formally state what is the learning problem that you are aiming to solve here? In what sense is a clustering of one dataset generalizable to another? Is there a danger that what one learns for a specific family of datasets is not generalizable to other datasets?''
Reviewer 4 also requested under specific focus that ``Can you please expand on the ``learning to cluster'' aspect of your work? What AUC is being computed and how?''
This is a valid concern, and we believe it is important to address.
\emph{We have attempted to clarify exactly how AUC is measured, what the learning problem is, and the risks regarding generalization}.

Reviewer 3 criticized the clarity of writing, in particular suggesting some ways to reorganize the manuscript.
Reviewer 5, in their highly positive review, also suggested some reorganization.
\emph{We have added a summary paragraph to the method description.}
Reviewer 3 claims ``This paper is difficult to understand in places because of typos, lack of organization, or another flaws. The paper would need significant/major improvement in writing,'' while in constrast Reviewer 5 says ``The clarity of the paper and additional codes is also generally good. The paper contains few grammatical errors and is presented in a logical sequence.''
We are unsure how to reconcile these two reviews, and cannot find any typographical or grammatical errors in the manuscript.
Reviewers 3 and 6 also claim that there are not enough details to reproduce the work, while Reviewers 4 and 5 claim that it is reproducible.
Note that source code was provided, and all quantitative results can be reproduced by running one script.
We apologize for the lack of clarity, and ask Reviewers 3 and 6 to please look at the supplementary material including source code.

Reviewer 6 correctly notes that the clustering method (CLAM) appears to be an adaptation of Ishaq, et al. 2019; this is true as stated in the manuscript.
However, there are significant differences from the 2019 paper.
In particular, CLAM learns an optimal stopping depth from training datasets, and this depth is not uniform; indeed, it is not a depth so much as a combination of geometric properties (including local fractal dimension) that \textbf{on the training sets} optimized anomaly detection performance. CHESS, the approach from the 2019 paper, merely clustered down to a pre-specified depth, as its goal was to build an index for search.
Furthermore, \textbf{CLAM learns a graph} from the cluster tree, and it is this graph, induced from the nonuniform depth just discussed, that is the true novelty of CLAM, and allows CHAODA to be built on top of CLAM.
\emph{We have added additional language to the manuscript to further highlight the differences}.
Reviewer 6 requests that we compare with REPEN, DAGMM, and others.
However, the REPEN source code on Github does not work as provided, while the DAGMM source code requires custom-tuning based on the dimensionality of the data, and we could not get it to run.
\emph{We have added additional datasets to our comparison as suggested in the review article mentioned, as well as a comparison to RDP, from Wang, et al. 2019}.
However, at the time of submission to ICML, that review article \textbf{was not yet published}; it was only published in March, 2021.
Thus, it seems unfair to request comparison to work that was unpublished at the time of submission.
Reviewer 6 also claims that an ablation study is needed.
We disagree; an ablation study is only really relevant to a deep-learning approach where different layers of the network can be removed to judge their efficacy.
However, CHAODA cannot run without the graph built by CLAM.
It is true that we could evaluate the performance of the individual components of CHAODA independently, which might be analogous to an ablation study.
\emph{We have added individual performance of the components of CHAODA to the supplement; we do not believe it is of sufficient interest to go into the main manuscript}.
