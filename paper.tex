    \begin{abstract}
        Anomaly and outlier detection in datasets is a long-standing problem in machine learning.
        In some cases, anomaly detection is easy, such as when data are drawn from well-characterized distributions such as the Gaussian.
        However, when data occupy high-dimensional spaces, anomaly detection becomes more difficult.
        We present CLAM (Clustered Learning of Approximate Manifolds), a fast hierarchical clustering technique that learns a manifold in a Banach space defined by a distance metric.
        CLAM induces a graph from the cluster tree, based on overlapping clusters determined by several geometric and topological features.
        On these graphs, we implement CHAODA (Clustered Hierarchical Anomaly and Outlier Detection Algorithms), exploring various properties of the graphs and their constituent clusters to compute scores of anomalousness.
        On 24 publicly available datasets, we compare the performance of CHAODA (by measure of ROC AUC) to a variety of state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly-detection algorithms.
        Six of the datasets are used for training.
        CHAODA outperforms other approaches on 14 of the remaining 18 datasets.

% Checklist:

% * range of hyperparameters:
% We have eliminated the hyper-parameters through the meta-ml.
% I guess the meta-ml method itself could be a hyper-parameter but at that point, screw it.

% * exact number of training and eval runs:
% Scores varied by < 0.02 with different random seeds.
% I did not keep track of how many runs I made, probably several dozen.

% * description of experiments, differences from previous work:
% The paper is almost unrecodnizable from the KDD version.
% Will source code be enough for this?

% * definition of performance measure:
% Does ROC-AUC need a citation?

% * average runtime/energy cost:
% in Supplement

% * description of computing infrastructure:
% We should describe Ark and Minsky in the paper or in the supplement.

% * dataset description:
% Summary in the paper, details in the supplement.

% * links to datasets:
% We cited ODDS and the code contains utilities to automatically download and pre-parse the datasets.

% * details of train/validation/test splits:
% Done. We only have the train/test splits

% * describe any excluded data and preprocessing step:
% We did not exclude any data.
% For preprocessing, we read whatever format the data is downloaded in (often .mat or .h5py) and then save them as numpy arrays.

% * describe mathematical setting/algorithm/model:
% Done.

% * explain assumptions:
% Done.
% Manifold hypothesis.

% * complexity analysis:
% Done.

% * Source code:
% I'm working on a self-contained folder for the review version.
% We have time for finishing up on git and getting permanenet commit-hashes for the camera-ready version.

% * statement of result:
% In abstract and Results section.

% * explain assumptions:
% same as earlier.

% * complete proofs of any claims.
% NA
